# HopeBox - Examples

Some code to prove different concepts on different platforms using different languages.

* `c-tcp/` - an example client and server on TCP that compiles and runs on a `Raspberry Pi`.
* `go-limefm` - a Go library used to communicate with the `LimeSDR`.
* `py-tcp` - the TCP client and server that runs on the `CC`.  __TODO: move to `cc/` and update as server.__
